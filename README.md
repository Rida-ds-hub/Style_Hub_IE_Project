## üìÅ Repository Contents  

- **`StyleHub.ipynb`**  
  This is the core implementation of the project. It contains the code for preprocessing, feature extraction, contrastive learning, and the recommendation pipeline.  

- **`StyleHub_Final.pptx`**  
  A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project, methodology, and results in a concise and visually engaging manner.  

- **`StyleHub___Assessing_Contrastive_Learning__for_Personalized_Fashion_Recommendations.pdf`**  
  The research paper detailing the project objectives, methods, experiments, results, and conclusions.  

- **Data Files**  
  - `.pkl` files: Preprocessed datasets used in the project.  
  - A document with links to additional `.pkl` files (too large to upload to GitHub). These should be downloaded and placed in the same directory as the notebook for seamless execution.
